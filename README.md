Blood
=====

Simulator for diffusion of "blood" in a grid system. Each cell first eats 
its fill then shares any food it has with neighboring cells. This project
runs a random genetic algorithm to try to optimize the density of food needed
for each grid cell (the total food needed stays constant). I'm curious if
it produces "veins" to distribute the food more quickly.
